Currently employed at GeoStrategies where I build and deploy models, maintain the database, develop and deploy pipelines, develop new products, and so much more. The code found on this page is mostly hobby projects from years past. Nowadays, my hobbies include reading, backpacking, riding motorcyles, and relaxing with my family.
